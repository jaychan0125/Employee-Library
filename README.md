## Description 
Employee Database using mySQL. This one was a challenge for me. I'm a bit frustrated right now since they've all been a challenge for me, but ever since everything has been separated into like so many different files, it has been hard for me to keep track of it all. Which is why I think the tables from databases are a bit confusing for me. I understand the concept of foreign key, and I'm getting a better understanding of JOINs, but implementing them properly still takes me a lot of research. Like originally my JOIN statement didn't have "LEFT JOIN" in it, and some of my rows weren't populating, and I couldn't figure out why, and fun things like that kept happening. But I overcame! These challenges are getting harder, and I'm honestly questioning myself, so I've had to keep reminding me it takes time to learn a  new skill and I'll definitely need to practice it more!
In this challenge, I’ve utilized mySQL, inquirer, and dotenv. Using workbench, I’ve used the schema and seed files to create my database. After installing all my packages and importing them so they can be used in my index file, we had to connect the database; this also utilized the dotenv package to help hide my password! And because the .env file is in my .gitignore, it won’t push my password to GitHub! I then used inquirer and a switch statement to help me make a directory to navigate through choices. There were a lot of querying through the databases to pull specific information needed for some of the prompts. Overall it was both cool and insanely frustrating for me to get this working!
